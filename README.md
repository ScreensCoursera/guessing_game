#The Guessing Game!!!
In the guessing game the user is guessing the right number of files in the actual directory.
Is the value greater then the actual number of files, then the player gets the information, that the guessed is 'too high'.
When the guessed value is lower then the number of files in the directory, the user gets the hint 'too low'.
And when the player guessed the correct number.. SURPRISE!
